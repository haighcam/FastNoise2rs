# A rust port of https://github.com/Auburn/FastNoise2Bindings

> Uses release 0.9.7-alpha of https://github.com/Auburn/FastNoise2

> FastNoise2 is dynamically linked, so libFastNoise2.so needs to be visible to the linker for this library to function.

Would probably be more portble if FastNoise2 was built and statically linked as part of the compile.
